# Public Health Protective Policy Index (PPI) Data Set

This is an original dataset of stringency of public health policy measures that were adopted in response to COVID-19 worldwide by governments at national and sub-national levels. The data set covers governments' policy responses between January 24, 2020 and December 31, 2020.

## A Brief Description

To measure COVID-19 mitigation policy responses, data is gathered on policies that national and sub-national policymakers adopted within fifteen public health categories. National and subnational public health policies are regionally and nationally identified and coded in 74 countries (subnational aggregates are presently published of USA and Canada only), including countries in North America, Central America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The full list of countries in the data set is illustrated in the codebook.   
The fifteen public health categories are state of emergency, self-isolation and quarantine, border closures, limits on social gatherings, school closings, closure of entertainment venues, closure of restaurants, closure of non-essential businesses, closure of government offices, work from home requirements, lockdowns and curfews, public transportation closures, and mandatory wearing of PPE. The primary resources used by this study during the data collection process are  government resources, press releases, and news sources, dating policies based on first announcement. Note that between and within the policy categories, there is variation on stringency, with some policy adoptions being more stringent than others (i.e. self-isolation versus lockdowns, partial school closings versus full school closings). To this end, more stringent policies are weighted more in each category and in the index. 

Based on coded public health policy responses to COVID-19, three categories of the Public Health Protective Policy Index (PPI) are produced: Regional PPI for each subnational unit on each day; National PPI for a country on each day, based on national level policies; and Total PPI for each subnational unit on each day. The Total PPI reflects the strictest between the national and subnational policies adopted within each category for that unit for that day. The indices are scaled to range between 0 and 1. The Average Total PPI for each country-day is computed by weighing the different units' Total PPI values by the units' population shares. These three categories for each country  mapped on [https://gis-core.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/3f6529f4f3eb41b190e653d88ce00043](the policy dashboard of the lab).
